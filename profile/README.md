## 💥 Introduction

Handle My Admission is a solution which provides an end-to-end platform for institutions to manage their admission process , as well as it acts as an on-stop solution for high school students to manage their college applications.

This platform's features include dynamic dashboards , query management system, dynamic notice board, application management, embedded payments, dynamic applications, calendar to track down the activity and up-to-date notifications to both types of utilizers.

It started with the idea to provide facilities to only one university, but now it’s pivoting towards SAAS.


## 💡 Why did we build this?

The very first reason was to reduce the costs of the solutions that our university was using. Later, we realized that there is no single SAAS platform for admission, where universities can post their openings and applicants can apply through a single platform, because each university currently has their own portal, making it difficult to track your application as a student when applying to many universities and openings.

## 🥁 Features

- Dynamic dashboards.
- Query management system.
- Application management system.
- Up-to-date notifications.
- Notice boards.
- Embedded calendars.
- Different payment modes powered by Razorpay.
